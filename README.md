### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python skills learned in Udacity's nano-degree program to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

#### Required metrics

1.	Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month most common day of week most common hour of day
2.	Popular stations and trip
most common start station most common end station most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
3.	Trip duration
total travel time average travel time
4.	User info
counts of each user type counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago) earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
